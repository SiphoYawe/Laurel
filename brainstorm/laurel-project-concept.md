# LAUREL: Project Concept Document

> **30 Days to Academic Transformation**

---

## Executive Summary

**Laurel** is an AI-powered daily coaching companion that transforms university students' academic resolutions into measurable results through science-backed habits and evidence-based learning methods.

Built for the **"Commit To Change: An AI Agents Hackathon"**, Laurel directly answers the hackathon's core challenge: *"Build AI that turns New Year's resolutions into real results."*

---

## The Problem

University students face three critical gaps:

| Gap | Description | How Students Experience It |
|-----|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Execution Gap** | Know what to do, can't make themselves do it | "I know I should use active recall, but I just... don't" |
| **Clarity Gap** | Overwhelmed by options, don't know where to start | "There's so much advice out there, what actually works?" |
| **Persistence Gap** | Start strong, fall off after weeks | "I was doing great in September, but by October..." |

---

## The Solution

**Laurel** addresses all three gaps through:

1. **Daily Coaching** → Solves execution gap through accountability
2. **Structured 30-Day Journey** → Solves clarity gap with clear path
3. **Adaptive AI Support** → Solves persistence gap with troubleshooting

### The Core Loop

```
Student: "I want to ace Organic Chemistry this semester"
                            ↓
         Laurel transforms this into:
         • Identity: "I am a strategic learner who masters complex material"
         • Habits: Daily active recall, spaced repetition, habit stacks
         • Methods: Evidence-based study techniques
                            ↓
         30 days of daily coaching:
         ☀️ Morning: Focus for today + motivation
         🌙 Evening: Reflection + troubleshooting + tomorrow prep
                            ↓
         Day 30: Measurable transformation
         "I went from struggling to understanding deeply"
```

---

## The Name: Why "Laurel"?

| Origin | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Ancient Greece/Rome | Laurel wreaths crowned **victors, scholars, and achievers** |
| "Laureate" | Someone who has achieved highest honors (Nobel Laureate, Poet Laureate) |
| "Baccalaureate" | Literally means "laurel berry" - the bachelor's degree |
| Symbol | Victory, achievement, academic excellence |

**Tagline Options:**
- "30 Days to Academic Transformation"
- "Earn your laurel"
- "Where resolutions become achievements"

---

## Target User

**Primary:** University/college students who:
- Set academic goals but struggle to follow through
- Want to improve grades but don't know the best methods
- Start each semester with good intentions that fade
- Are willing to commit to a 30-day program

**Psychographic:** Ambitious but frustrated. They WANT to succeed but feel like something's missing between intention and action.

## Daily Interaction Model

### Morning Check-in (2-3 minutes)
```
Laurel: "Good morning! Day 12 of your journey to ace Organic Chemistry.

Today's focus: Your first active recall session on Chapter 5.
Remember - struggle is good! When retrieval feels hard, that's
your brain building stronger pathways.

Your habit stack for today:
☕ After morning coffee → Open Orgo notes → 10 min active recall

What's one thing that might get in the way today?"

Student: "I have a group project meeting at the time I usually study"

Laurel: "Good catch! Let's plan around it. Can you do a quick
5-minute recall session before the meeting instead? Even micro-sessions
count. The two-minute rule: just open the notes. Once you start,
you'll likely do more."
```

### Evening Reflection (2-3 minutes)
```
Laurel: "How did today go with your active recall session?"

Student: "I only did 5 minutes before the meeting, but I actually
did another 15 minutes after dinner"

Laurel: "That's a WIN! You adapted instead of skipping entirely.
That's the 'never miss twice' principle in action - you showed up
even when the schedule changed.

What did you recall from Chapter 5? Tell me one thing without
looking at your notes."

Student: "Um... the SN1 mechanism involves a carbocation intermediate"

Laurel: "Perfect! You just did active recall right now. That
moment of struggle before you remembered? That strengthened the
memory.

Tomorrow we'll do a quick check on Chapter 5 again - that's
spaced repetition working for you.

Sleep well - your brain will consolidate what you learned today!"
```

## Opik Integration Strategy

### The Three-Layer Approach

#### Layer 1: Quality (Prove the coach is GOOD)

| Metric | What It Measures | Target |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| Dialogue Helpfulness | Is each response actually useful? | >90% helpful |
| User Frustration | Are we annoying or stressing students? | <5% frustration signals |
| Session Completeness | Did each check-in achieve its goal? | >85% complete |
| Answer Relevance | Are responses on-topic? | >95% relevant |

#### Layer 2: Optimization (Show the coach gets BETTER)

| Feature | How We Use It | Demo Value |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| HRPO Optimizer | Auto-improve coaching prompts based on helpfulness scores | Before/after comparison |
| Prompt Versioning | Track which coaching approaches work best | Show iteration history |
| Failure Analysis | Identify where coaching fails and why | Root cause insights |
| A/B Testing | Test different prompt strategies | Data-driven decisions |

#### Layer 3: Outcomes (Prove it actually WORKS)

| Metric | What It Measures | Demo Value |
|--------|-----------------|------------|
| Resolution Progress | % movement toward stated goal | Transformation story |
| Habit Formation | Number of habits that became automatic | Behavioral change proof |
| Journey Completion | % of students finishing 30 days | Engagement validation |
| Quality→Outcome Correlation | Does better coaching = better results? | The ultimate proof |

## Hackathon Category Strategy

### Primary Category: Personal Growth & Learning ($5,000)

**Alignment:**
- ✅ "Design experiences that make learning engaging"
- ✅ "Skill development trackers that adapt to your learning pace"
- ✅ "Personal reflection tools that help document and learn from experiences"

**Differentiators:**
- Not just tracking - active coaching
- Not generic learning - resolution-focused transformation
- Not just tips - full 30-day structured journey

### Bonus Category: Best Use of Opik ($5,000)

**Alignment:**
- ✅ Deep tracing of all coaching conversations
- ✅ LLM-as-judge evaluation (helpfulness, frustration, completeness)
- ✅ HRPO optimizer for continuous prompt improvement
- ✅ Outcome correlation (quality → results)
- ✅ Dashboard visualization for judges

**Demo Strategy:**
1. Show live conversation trace in Opik
2. Show evaluation scores on coaching responses
3. Show before/after optimization improvements
4. Show correlation: better coaching → better outcomes
