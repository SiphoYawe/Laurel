# Product Brief: Laurel

## Executive Summary

**Laurel** is an AI-powered daily coaching companion that transforms university students' academic resolutions into measurable results through science-backed habits and evidence-based learning methods.

Built for the "Commit To Change: An AI Agents Hackathon," Laurel directly answers the hackathon's core challenge: *"Build AI that turns New Year's resolutions into real results."*

The product delivers a structured 30-day transformation journey combining James Clear's Atomic Habits framework with evidence-based learning techniques (active recall, spaced repetition, Pareto principle), all guided by an adaptive AI coach that provides daily morning motivation and evening reflection.

**Target Categories:** Personal Growth & Learning ($5k) + Best Use of Opik ($5k)

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

University students face three critical gaps between intention and achievement:

| Gap | Description | Student Experience |
|-----|-------------|-------------------|
| **Execution Gap** | Know what to do, can't make themselves do it | "I know I should use active recall, but I just... don't" |
| **Clarity Gap** | Overwhelmed by options, don't know where to start | "There's so much advice out there, what actually works?" |
| **Persistence Gap** | Start strong, fall off after weeks | "I was doing great in September, but by October..." |

### Problem Impact

Students who fail to bridge these gaps experience:
- Repeated cycle of goal-setting and abandonment
- Declining academic performance despite good intentions
- Erosion of self-efficacy and confidence
- Frustration from the disconnect between ambition and action

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

Current solutions address pieces but not the whole:
- **Habit trackers** - Track behavior but don't teach *what* habits matter or *how* to build them
- **Study apps** - Provide techniques but don't help form the habit of using them
- **Generic productivity tools** - Not tailored to academic context or student psychology
- **One-time advice** - Tips without accountability or adaptive support

None provide the **daily coaching + structured journey + evidence-based methods** combination.

### Proposed Solution

Laurel solves all three gaps through an integrated approach:

1. **Daily Coaching** → Solves execution gap through accountability and just-in-time guidance
2. **Structured 30-Day Journey** → Solves clarity gap with a clear, progressive path
3. **Adaptive AI Support** → Solves persistence gap with troubleshooting and "never miss twice" recovery

**The Core Loop:**
```
Student Resolution → Identity Transformation → Daily Habit Stacks →
Morning Focus + Evening Reflection → 30-Day Measurable Transformation
```

### Key Differentiators

| Differentiator | Why It Matters |
|----------------|----------------|
| **30-Day Structured Journey** | Not open-ended - clear start, middle, end with graduation moment |
| **Dual Framework Foundation** | Atomic Habits + Evidence-Based Learning = behavior change + effective methods |
| **Daily Touch Points** | Morning motivation + evening reflection maintains engagement |
| **Identity-First Approach** | "I am a strategic learner" vs. "I should study more" |
| **Deep Opik Integration** | Three-layer observability: Quality → Optimization → Outcomes |
| **Resolution-Focused** | Built specifically for turning goals into results, not generic productivity |
