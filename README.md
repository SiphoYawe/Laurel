## Overview

Laurel is an AI-powered personal development assistant that helps users achieve their goals through:

- **Atomic Habits methodology** - James Clear's proven system for building good habits and breaking bad ones
- **Evidence-based learning techniques** - Active recall, spaced repetition, and productivity systems backed by cognitive science
- **LLM observability with Opik** - Transparent AI coaching with traceable, evaluable interactions

## Hackathon

| | |
|---|---|
| **Event** | Commit To Change - AI Agents Hackathon |
| **Organizer** | Encode Club |
| **Sponsor** | Comet (Opik) |
| **Duration** | January 13 - February 2026 |
| **Prize Pool** | $30,000 USD |

### Target Category
- Personal Growth & Learning

## Features

### Habit Formation Engine
Based on the **Four Laws of Behavior Change**:

| Law | Build Good Habits | Break Bad Habits |
|-----|-------------------|------------------|
| 1st | Make it Obvious | Make it Invisible |
| 2nd | Make it Attractive | Make it Unattractive |
| 3rd | Make it Easy | Make it Difficult |
| 4th | Make it Satisfying | Make it Unsatisfying |

Key capabilities:
- Implementation intentions and habit stacking
- Environment design recommendations
- Identity-based habit formation
- Streak tracking with "never miss twice" philosophy

### Learning Optimization System
Built on the **Five Pillars of Effective Learning**:

| Pillar | Description | Key Technique |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Active Engagement | Force retrieval, not passive absorption | Active Recall |
| Strategic Timing | Fight the forgetting curve | Spaced Repetition |
| Desirable Difficulty | Embrace productive struggle | Interleaved Practice |
| Quality Over Quantity | Hours ≠ learning | Pareto Principle |
| System Design | Automate success | Productivity Systems |

Key capabilities:
- Spaced repetition scheduling
- Active recall prompts
- Study session optimization
- Procrastination intervention

## Tech Stack

- **Opik** - LLM observability, tracing, and evaluation
- **LLM Integration** - AI coaching with machine-readable frameworks

## Core Principles

### The 1% Rule
Small improvements compound exponentially:
- 1% better daily = **37x improvement** in one year
- 1% worse daily = decline to 3% of starting point

### Identity First
Change happens from the inside out:
1. **Identity** (Who you are)
2. **Processes** (What you do)
3. **Outcomes** (What you get)

### Systems Over Goals
Focus on the process, not the outcome. Goals set direction; systems make progress.

### The Pareto Principle
Focus on the 20% that yields 80% of results—in learning, habits, and life.
